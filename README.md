Based on the following analysis of school performance, spending, size, and type, two notable trends emerged:

- Firsty, charter schools significantly outperform district schools across all metrics: average scores, percentage passing rates, and overall passing rates. For instance, charter schools have an average math score of approximately 83.47 and a reading score of 83.90, with around 90.43% of students passing overall. In contrast, district schools have lower average scores in both subjects, with only about 53.67% of students passing overall. This suggests that an imbalance in resources may contribute to student learning outcomes.

- School size plays a role in student performance as well, with smaller schools showing better overall passing rates compared to large schools. Small schools (<1000 students) and medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) have overall passing rates of about 89.88% and 90.62%, respectively. In contrast, large schools (2000-5000 students) have a significantly lower overall passing rate of 58.29%. This trend suggests that smaller school environments, which might offer more personalized attention and less crowded classrooms, are more conducive to student success.

These trends underscore the importance of school environment and structure in student academic performance. Charter schools and smaller-sized schools appear to offer conditions that are more favorable for student achievement, highlighting potential areas for policy and investment focus to improve education outcomes for all.
